# JavaScript Boilerplate

#### A boilerplate that sets the grounds for any kind of JS development. More of the generic things, less of the specific things.

It has
- formatting
- linting
- editor options
- gitignore
- [~~npmignore~~ npm files](https://github.com/c-hive/guides/blob/master/js/package.md#what-to-include)
- [dependency comments](https://github.com/c-hive/guides/blob/master/js/misc.md#comment-dependencies-in-the-packagejson)
